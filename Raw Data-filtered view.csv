Thanks to Flutter, you don't need to learn Android/ Java and iOS/ Swift to build real native mobile apps!

Because Flutter - a framework developed by Google - allows you to learn one language (Dart) and build beautiful native mobile apps in no time. Flutter is a SDK providing the tooling to compile Dart code into native code and also gives you a rich set of pre-built and pre-styled UI elements (so called widgets) which you can use to compose your user interfaces.

Because of its ease of use and flexibility, Flutter is an extremely popular solution for building native mobile apps for Android & iOS.This course will teach Flutter & Dart from scratch, NO prior knowledge of either of the two is required! And you certainly don't need any Android or iOS development experience since the whole idea behind Flutter is to only learn one language.

The course will start at the very basics and teach you Flutter & Dart step-by-step, from the ground up. You'll learn about all core concepts, the base Dart syntax and also many crucial advanced features - therefore, by the end of the course, you'll be able to build your own Flutter apps.

Of course, you'll learn Flutter not only in theory but by building multiple, realistic demo apps, allowing you to apply what you learned on real examples.

With Flutter, you'll be able to write code only once and ship your apps both to the Apple AppStore and Google Play.

You can use the rich widget suite Flutter provides to add common UI elements like buttons, switches, forms, toolbars, lists and more. Or you simply build your own widgets - Flutter makes that a breeze, too. This course covers it all!Here's what's included in the course:


Detailed setup instructions for both macOS and Windows
A thorough introduction to Flutter, Dart and the concept behind widgets
An overview of the built-in widgets and how you may add your own ones
Debugging tipps & tricks
Page navigation with tabs, side drawers and stack-based navigation
State management solutions
Handling and validating user input
Connecting your Flutter app to backend servers by sending HTTP requests
User authentication
Adding Google Maps
Using native device features like the camera
Adding beautiful animations & page transitions
Image upload
Push Notifications - manual approach and automated
And more!

This course is for you if ...


You're interested in building real native mobile apps for the two most popular mobile platforms - iOS and Android
You want to explore the full set of features Flutter offers
Don't want to spend hours learning two completely different languages

Course prerequisites:

Yet it is a concept that can be intimidating at first, hence many developers shy away from diving into testing and adding tests to their projects.

This course will teach you automated unit & integration testing with JavaScript from the ground up. You will learn how tests are written and added to your projects, what should (and should not) be tested and how you can test both simple as well as more complex code.

You will learn about the software and setup required to write automated tests and example projects will be provided as part of the course. It's a hands-on, practical course, hence you won't get stuck in theory - instead you'll be able to learn all key concepts at real examples.In the course, Vitest will be used as the main testing library & tool. It's a modern JavaScript test runner and assertion library that provides Jest compatibility. Hence what you'll learn in this course will help you no matter if you're working with Vitest or Jest. And the core concepts will apply, no matter which testing setup you're using at all!

As part of this course, typical testing problems will be defined and solved and common strategies like mocking or working with spies are taught in great detail. This course also does not focus on specific types of JavaScript projects - neither does it focus on any specific library or framework.

Instead, you'll learn how to automatically test your (vanilla) JavaScript code, no matter if it's a NodeJS or frontend project. The fundamentals you'll gain in this course will help you in all your future projects - backend (NodeJS) and frontend (vanilla JS, React, Vue, Angular) alike.

This course will provide you with an extremely solid foundation to build up on, such that you can start adding tests to all your JavaScript projects.In detail, this course will teach you:


What exactly ""testing"" or ""automated testing"" is (and why you need it)
What ""unit testing"" is specifically
Which tools you need to enable automated unit tests in your projects
How to write unit tests
How to get started with integration tests
How to formulate different expectations (assertions)
Which patterns to follow when writing tests
How to test asynchronous and synchronous code
How to deal with side effects with help of spies & mocks
How to apply all these concepts in real projects & examples5+

It's used by many popular database management systems like MySQL or PostgreSQL. But it's also used by data analysis and big data frameworks and tools like Apache Spark.

Hence knowing SQL opens up an endless amount of opportunities and jobs - no matter if you're going to work with relational databases or if you're becoming a data scientist, knowing SQL will be key!This course teaches you SQL from the ground up and in extremely high detail! In addition, this course comes with two main paths that you can take:


The ""Complete Course"" path where you go through the entire course, step by step, learning about ALL the key features and concepts you have to know
The ""Quick Summary"" path where you can learn the key SQL essentials within a few hours

Both paths are included in this course (i.e. with one single purchase) and you can switch between them or take both - simply as it makes most sense for you! Dive into the free first course section to learn all about this course and these two paths (and how to take them).

SQL is a standardized language and therefore learning SQL will help you apply it in all kinds of contexts. Nonetheless, different database systems also support different aspects of SQL or bring their own variations of the SQL language. Therefore, this course dives into SQL by exploring all key features at the example of the two most popular database systems: MySQL and PostgreSQL. All query and command examples are shown for both database systems, ensuring that you feel comfortable working with SQL in either environment!This course will enable you to write your own (simple or complex) SQL queries, create basic or advanced database and table structures and work with data of different shape and complexity!

In detail, you will learn:


What exactly SQL is and how the core syntax looks like
How to write SQL commands
How to install MySQL & PostgreSQL as well as various clients
How to create and structure database tables
Which data types you may use and when to use which data type
How to perform CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update & Delete Data
How to insert data into tables
How to query and filter data
Why you should split data across multiple tables (and how to do that)
How to join (merge) data into combined result sets
How to write basic and more complex queries
How to aggregate and group data
How to use built-in database functions to work with numbers, text or dates
How to optimize databases with indexes
And much, much more!

THIS COURSE IS FOR BEGINNERS & ADVANCED DEVELOPERS

It will teach you web development and turn you into a web developer in 100 days - or allow you to refresh key essentials and expand your existing knowledge!

Becoming a web developer is a great choice because web development opens up many career paths and web development skills are required in pretty much every business that exists today - and of course this will only increase in the future!

It's not just about websites - it's also about ""behind the scenes"" services used by mobile apps like Uber or AirBnB. It's about rich web apps like Google Docs as well as browser games. And of course also about regular websites like Facebook, online blogs, online shops like Amazon and much, much more!

Hence it's no wonder, that web developers are in high demand! And, besides great job perspectives, as a web developer, you can of course also easily build your own digital business!This Course Is For You!

This course will teach you web development from the ground up and thanks to the ""100 Days Of Code Challenge"" which is incorporated into this course (though it's optional to commit to it!), you can become a web developer in 100 days with help of this course!

No prior web development knowledge is required at all to get started with this course. We will explore all important basics, all fundamentals and all key concepts together, step by step.

But this course is also for advanced students who already do have web development knowledge! It's a deep-dive course and hence you will be able to expand your existing knowledge by diving deeper into key fundamentals like HTML, CSS or NodeJS and also by exploring advanced concepts like handling payments, building REST APIs or website security.

Since it's a huge course, the course is built in a modular way. This means, that you can take it step by step, lecture by lecture but you can also jump right into the course sections that are most interesting to you. Of course, we recommend the ""step-by-step"" approach for beginners - simply because all the lectures and sections build up on each other. But as a more experienced developer, you can of course skip basics that aren't interesting to you!The 100 Days Of Code Challenge

We built this course with the ""100 Days Of Code Challenge"" in mind - a challenge (not invented by us) that aims to keep you motivated to code for at least 1 hour per day for 100 days.

Since this is a huge course (with around 80 hours of content!) it can be very overwhelming. And we know that many students never finish a course.

That's a pitty, because this course is packed with content, exercises, quizzes, assignments and demo projects! We build a browser-game, a blog, a travel website, an online shop and much, much more.

Therefore, we provide clear guidance on how you can take this course from A to Z within 100 days by spending 1 to 2 hours per day watching videos and learning. As part of the course, you get access to a companion website that provides a clear structure and you also find annotations right in the course curriculum.

Of course taking this ""100 Days"" challenge is totally optional though! You can take the course at your own pace as well and skip any content you're not interested in!Try It Risk-Free

This course comes with a 30 day money-back guarantee. If you find out that it's not for you, you can get your money back, no questions asked!

What You Will Learn

This is a huge course, packed with content and it's the web development bootcamp we would have loved to have when we learned web development.

Next.js is the production-ready, fullstack-capable framework for ReactJS - the most popular JavaScript library you can learn these days!

Too many buzzwords for your taste?

Fair enough - but indeed, NextJS is a great choice for growing as a React developer and for taking your React apps to the next level!

Because NextJS is growing fast and therefore in high demand. And there are good reasons for that: NextJS allows you to build React apps with built-in server-side rendering and page pre-rendering. Building great user experiences and search engine friendly (SEO!) React apps has never been easier!In addition, NextJS makes building fullstack React apps (frontend + backend code combined in one project) extremely easy as well! Blend client-side and server-side code and build a NodeJS-based API side-by-side with your frontend React apps. It's a breeze with NextJS!

Want to add authentication? NextJS simplifies that as well and makes user signup, sign in and session management very convenient.

This course will take you from NextJS beginner to advanced level in no time!

We'll start at the very basics, no NextJS knowledge is required at all, and we'll then dive into all the core features that make up NextJS. Both in theory as well as with multiple real projects where all concepts will be applied step-by-step.

For this course, you'll need basic React knowledge, though the course does come with a ""React refresher"" module in case it's been some time since you last worked with React.

This course also includes a ""NextJS Summary"" module which allows you to always come back to the course in the future and refresh your knowledge without going through the full course again. Or you just take that summary module (and skip the rest for now) to learn about all the core features in as little time as possible.

After finishing this course, you'll be well prepared to build your own NextJS projects from the ground up and apply for NextJS positions!In detail, this course will cover:


What is NextJS? And why would you use it?
Why is just React (in many cases) not enough?
Creating NextJS projects from the ground up & understanding these projects
Working with file-based routing
Adding dynamic routes and catch-all routes
Implementing different forms of page pre-rendering and server-side rendering
Working with data and adding data fetching + pre-fetching to your apps
Pre-generating dynamic and static pages
Adding optimizations like metadata to pages
Optimizing images with the NextJS Image component
Building fullstack apps with API routes
Managing app-wide state with React context (in NextJS apps)
Adding authentication to NextJS apps
Multiple complete apps where we'll apply all these core concepts!
A complete React.js refresher module (so that we're all on the same page)
A NextJS summary module so that you can refresh what you learned or just explore the core features quickly

We already got a Python course which you can take if you want to learn Python.

But one of the primary things you can build with Python is a website! You can use Python for web development.

And to make that easier, you would typically use a framework like Django - simply because that allows you to focus on your core business logic and you don't need to re-invent the wheel and implement all the nitty-gritty technical details from scratch.

And this course is about Django - the most popular Python web development framework out there!

Django covers all aspects of web development - from handling requests and responses, over rendering dynamic HTML pages with templates, all the way up to making database access and data management easy. It's all baked in and it's all covered in great detail in this course!This course teaches Django from the ground up - you don't need to know anything about it to get started. Basic Python and web development knowledge is all you need.

We'll start at the absolute basics and understand how to create Django project, how to run them and how to add features - step by step.

In detail, this course covers:


Installing Django
Creating and understanding Django projects
Understanding URLs, views, requests and responses
Working with templates and static files like CSS and images
Working with data and models
Connecting data with relationships (one-to-many, one-to-one, many-to-many)
Querying data with Django's powerful model solution
Adding administration panels to your projects
Handling user input with forms - manually and with Django's built-in form support
Advanced features like class-based views (and when to use them)
Dealing with file uploads and how to serve uploaded files
Working with sessions
In-depth deployment instructions and examples
Different ways of deploying and serving static files and user uploads
And much more!

All those concepts are taught in great depth and backed up by a complete example course project where we build a ""Blog website"" from the ground up.

Therefore, you'll learn all the important concepts and the theory and you're also going to be able to see it applied to a real project.

Hence, once you completed the course, you'll have a very solid understanding of Django and you'll be able to dive into your own Django projects!20+

You don't need to learn Android/ Java and iOS/ Swift to build real native mobile apps!

Flutter - a framework developed by Google - allows you to learn one language (Dart) and build beautiful native mobile apps in no time. Flutter is a SDK providing the tooling to compile Dart code into native code and it also gives you a rich set of pre-built and pre-styled UI elements (so called widgets) which you can use to compose your user interfaces.

Flutter is extremely trending and gets used for major Google apps like their Adwords app - it's now marked as ""ready for production"", hence now is the time to jump in and learn it!This course will teach Flutter & Dart from scratch, NO prior knowledge of either of the two is required! And you certainly don't need any Android or iOS development experience since the whole idea behind Flutter is to only learn one language.

You'll learn Flutter not only in theory but we'll build a complete, realistic app throughout this course. This app will feature both all the core basics as well as advanced features like using Google Maps, the device camera, adding animations and more!

With Flutter, you'll be able to write code only once and ship your apps both to the Apple AppStore and Google Play.

Use Google's Material Design to build beautiful, yet fully customizable, apps in no time with almost zero effort. You can use the rich widget suite Flutter provides to add common UI elements like buttons, switches, forms, toolbars, lists and more - or you simply build your own widgets - Flutter makes that a breeze, too.Here's what's included in the course:


Detailed setup instructions for both macOS and Windows
A thorough introduction to Flutter, Dart and the concept behind widgets
An overview of the built-in widgets and how you may add your own ones
Debugging tipps & tricks
Page navigation with tabs, side drawers and stack-based navigation
State management solutions
Handling and validating user input
Connecting your Flutter app to backend servers by sending Http requests
User authentication
Adding Google Maps
Using native device features like the camera
Adding beautiful animations & page transitions
How to publish your app to the app stores

Unfortunately, a lot of developers write bad code nonetheless - even though the code works. Because ""working code"" is not the same as ""clean code""!

This course teaches you how to write clean code - code which is easy to read and understand by humans, not just computers!

In this course, you'll learn what exactly clean code is and, more importantly, how you can write clean code. Because if your code is written in a clean way, it's easier to read and understand and therefore easier to maintain.

Because it's NOT just the computer who needs to understand your code - your colleagues and your future self needs to be able to understand it as well!In this course, we'll dive into all the main ""pain points"" related to clean code (or bad code - depending on how you look at it) and you will not just learn what makes up bad code but of course also how to turn it into clean code.

Specifically, you will learn about:


Naming ""things"" (variables, properties, classes, functions, ...) properly and in a clean way
Common pitfalls and mistakes you should avoid when naming things
Comments and that most of them are bad
Good comments you might consider adding to your code
Code formatting - both horizontal and vertical formatting
Functions and how to limit the number of function parameters
How to write clean functions by focusing on ""one thing""
How levels of abstraction help you split functions and keep them small
How to write DRY functions and avoid unexpected side effects
Avoiding deeply nested control structures with guards and by extracting functionality into functions
Errors and error handling as a replacement for if-statements
Objects & data containers/ data structures and why that differentiation could matter
Cohesion and how to write good (small!) classes
The Law of Demeter and why it matters for clean code
What the SOLID principles are and why they matter when it comes to writing clean code
Much more!This course is a compilation of common patterns, best practices, principles and rules related to writing clean code.

In this course, you'll learn about a broad variety of concepts, rules, ideas, thoughts and principles and by the end of course, you'll have a good idea of what to keep in mind when it comes to writing clean code.

This is not a design patterns or general patterns course though - we will entirely focus on patterns, rules and concepts that help with writing clean code specifically.

All these concepts and rules are backed up by examples, code snippets and demos. And to ensure that you get the most out of this course, and you don't just learn a bunch of theory which you forget soon after, there also are plenty of challenges for you to apply what you learned!

This course uses Python, JavaScript and TypeScript for code examples but you don't need to know these languages to follow along and get a lot out of the course. In addition, the course does not focus on a specific programming style or paradigm (like functional programming, object-oriented programming etc) but instead covers general concepts and techniques which will always apply.6+

Git (a version control system) and Github (a cloud provider for Git managed projects) form an outstanding combination to provide the best possible experience to create and maintain a clearly structured project history!

This course will guide everyone (no prior knowledge is required!) through the core steps required to use these tools in your daily projects with ease.What is Version Control?

Saving & accessing data and tracking changes is what version control is all about. No matter if you're working on a private or a professional development project, code evolves, changes and continuously gets improved. A clean version management structure is therefore key to successfully manage the progress of your projects.

What is Git?

Git is a 100% free version management tool, specifically created for and used by developers all over the world to manage project code history locally on their machines (Windows, macOS, Linux/Unix).

What is GitHub?

GitHub is an online service, it is also free for many use-cases (just an account must be created) and it brings Git's local ""file-tracking"" strengths to the cloud. Storing project code online, accessing other team members' code or even updating code - all possible with the help of GitHub!

Why Should I Know these Tools?

Every project needs proper version control so not knowing Git and GitHub makes your daily developer life a lot more complicated (same if you're currently looking for a new job in the industry). Although Git and GitHub are user-friendly, both come with their own logic and ""language"". Getting started therefore can be a bit cumbersome and this is where this course comes into play!What do I Learn in this Course?

This course starts at the very basics, no prior Git or GitHub knowledge is required! You'll learn how to use Git and how to write Git commands in the Mac Terminal or the Windows Command Prompt (refreshers on both are also part of the course).

Starting with the first initialization of a so-called Git repository, we'll build up your knowledge step-by-step and understand the what & why behind concepts like branches, commits, the staging area, merging & rebasing, cloning, pushing & pulling branches and a lot more!

What's Inside this Course?


An optional Command Line Crash Course for both Windows & MacOS users
Git Download & Installation
Git Theory - Working Directory, Staging Area (Index) and Repository explained
Creating Git Repositories
Working with Commits

Understanding Branches

Understanding the HEAD and the detached HEAD

In this course we'll find answers to questions like:

""How can I delete my last commit?""

""What is the Stash?""

""What is the difference between a merge and a rebase (and what is cherry-picking then)?""

""How to bring back a deleted commit?""

Student #2:

You already have some experience with other frontend frameworks like Angular (2+) or ReactJS. But either due to interest or disappointment of the existing frameworks, you seek some alternatives - VueJS might be what you were looking for!

Student #3:

Has experience with backend frameworks/ languages but now also wants to enter the frontend world. VueJS is an awesome choice here, it's fun, it uses native JS and it's extremely powerful!

Bonus: Student #4

Is disappointed by Angular 2+. Does a good framework need 2 hours of setup? No, certainly not - as VueJS will prove to this student!

And if you don't know the two mentioned frameworks: That's fine, too, this course does not expect any knowledge of any other frontend framework - you will learn it all throughout this Course!This course covers it all!

We'll start at the very basics, what Vue.js is and how it works before we move on to more complex and advanced topics but I'll be honest: It's too much to fit it all into one sentence, so here's what you'll learn in this Course:



What is VueJS and Why would you use it?
Setting up a Development Environment and Workflow

The Basics (including the basic Syntax, Understanding Templates and much more!)

Interacting with DOM (Rendering Lists, Conditionally attaching/ detaching Elements ...)
Using Components (and what Components are to begin with)
Binding to Form Inputs
All about Directives, Filters and Mixins

How to make your App more Beautiful with Animations and Transitions

How to create an awesome Single-Page-Application (SPA) with Routing

How to improve State Management by using Vuex

How to Deploy the App
And much more ...

And all the accompanied with many exercises and multiple course projects - because it isn't just about seeing code, it's about using and practicing it!Is this course for you?

Now that you know what this course is about, let's see if this course is for you!

Here are three types of students who will love this course:

Student #1:

Has some JavaScript experience and is interested in what this language can do. He heard and read that JavaScript allows you to create nice web applications and enhance existing web pages. VueJS is your choice!

Student #2:

He already has some experience with other frontend frameworks like Angular (2+) or ReactJS. But either due to interest or disappointment of the existing frameworks, he seeks some alternatives - VueJS might be what you were looking for!

Student #3:

Has experience with backend frameworks/ languages but now also wants to enter the frontend world. VueJS is an awesome choice here, it's fun, it uses native JS and it's extremely powerful!

Bonus: Student #4

Is disappointed by Angular 2+. Does a good framework need 2 hours of setup? No, certainly not - as VueJS will prove to this student!

Node.js is probably THE most popular and modern server-side programming language you can dive into these days!

Node.js developers are in high demand and the language is used for everything from traditional web apps with server-side rendered views over REST APIs all the way up to GraphQL APIs and real-time web services. Not to mention its applications in build workflows for projects of all sizes.

This course will teach you all of that! From scratch with zero prior knowledge assumed. Though if you do bring some knowledge, you'll of course be able to quickly jump into the course modules that are most interesting to you.Here's what you'll learn in this course:


Node.js Basics & Basic Core Modules
Parsing Requests & Sending Responses
Rendering HTML Dynamically (on the Server)
Using Express.js
Working with Files and generating PDFs on the Server (on-the-fly)
File Up- and Download
Using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern
Using Node.js with SQL (MySQL) and Sequelize
Using Node.js with NoSQL (MongoDB) and Mongoose
Working with Sessions & Cookies
User Authentication and Authorization
Sending E-Mails
Validating User Input
Data Pagination
Handling Payments with Stripe.js
Building REST APIs
Authentication in REST APIs
File Upload in REST APIs
Building GraphQL APIs
Authentication in GraphQL APIs
File Upload in GraphQL APIs
Building a Realtime Node.js App with Websockets
Automated Testing (Unit Tests)
Deploying a Node.js Application
And Way More!Does this look like a lot of content? It certainly is!

This is not a short course but it is the ""Complete Guide"" on Node.js after all. We'll dive into a lot of topics and we'll not just scratch the surface.

We'll also not just walk through boring theory and some slides. Instead, we'll build two major projects: An online shop (including checkout + payments) and a blog.

All topics and features of the course will be shown and used in these projects and you'll therefore learn about them in a realistic environment.

Is this course for you?

If you got no Node.js experience, you'll love this course because it starts with zero knowledge assumed. It's the perfect course to become a Node.js developer.

If you got basic Node.js experience, this course is also a perfect match because you can go through the basic modules quickly and you'll benefit from all the deep dives and advanced topics the course covers.

Are you an advanced Node.js user? Check the curriculum then. Maybe you found no other course that shows how to use SQL with Node.js. Or you're interested in GraphQL. Chances are, that you'll get a lot of value out of this course, too!40+

Why?

Because they significantly simplify the development and deployment process of both simple and complex software projects. Especially in web development (though not limited to that), Docker can really take you to the next level!

With Docker, you can create and manage so-called ""Containers"" - basically packages of code and tools required to run that code. These containers allow you to run your programs in a predictable, environment-independent way - no matter where you need to run it.

For modern DevOps but also for local development - on your own or in a team - this is a winner feature since you will no longer have any ""but it worked on my machine"" discussions. It works inside of a container, hence it works everywhere!This course will teach you both Docker & Kubernetes from the ground up by using a practice-oriented approach!

We'll explore all key concepts in detail and with practical examples and demos - from images and containers, over volumes and networking all the way up to deployment and Kubernetes Cluster: This course has it all!

In detail, this course includes the following topics:


A thorough introduction to Docker, containers and why you might want to use it
Detailed setup instructions for macOS and Windows
A deep-dive into the core concepts you need to know: Containers & images
Learn how to create custom images, use existing images and how to run containers based on such images
Get a detailed overview of the core commands you need when working with Docker
Learn how to work with data and how to persist data with volumes
Explore container networking - with the outside world and between multiple containers
Learn how to work with both single and multi-container projects
In-depth deployment instructions: Manual deployment and deployment with managed services like AWS ECS
Understand Kubernetes core concepts & architecture
Learn how to create Kubernetes resources, deployments, services and how to run your containers with Kubernetes
Dive deeply into working with data in Kubernetes projects - with different types of volumes
Kubernetes networking and DNS service discovery
Learn how to deploy your Kubernetes project (at the example of AWS EKS)
And much more!All these topics are taught in great detail with slides and theory but also, most importantly, with many examples and demo!

You'll find tons of demo projects throughout the course - using programming languages like NodeJS, Python or PHP (with Laravel). You don't need to know these languages to follow along though, no worries!



This course is for:


Everyone who has NOT worked with Docker or Kubernetes at all
Everyone who is struggling with understanding what exactly Docker is (and why you might want to use it)

THE must-have JavaScript resource in 2020.,"JavaScript is THE most important programming language you need to learn as a web developer - and with this course, you make sure that you will not miss a single thing you have to know as a JavaScript developer!

This is the most comprehensive and modern course you can find on JavaScript - it's based on all my JavaScript knowledge AND teaching experience. It's both a complete guide, starting with the core basics of the language, as well as an extensive reference of the JavaScript language and environment, ensuring that both newcomers as well as experienced JavaScript developers get a lot out of this course!It's a huge course because it's packed with important knowledge and helpful content. From the core basics, over advanced concepts and JavaScript specialties, all the way up to expert topics like performance optimization and testing - this course has it all. My goal was to create your go-to resource for the JavaScript language, which you can not just use for learning it but also as a resource you can come back to and look up important topics.

The course is based on my experience as a long-term JavaScript developer as well as a teacher with more than 1,000,000 students online. It's packed with examples, demos, projects, assignments, quizzes and of course videos - all with the goal of giving you the best possible way of learning JavaScript.What's in the course?

This course is obviously packed with content - I therefore strongly recommend that you check out the full course curriculum to get a clear idea of all the topics covered in the course. In general, here's what you'll find in the course:


Modern JavaScript from the start: The JavaScript syntax changed over time - in this course, you'll learn the latest syntax from the start (you'll also learn about the old one though, so that you can work in ANY JS project)
ALL the Basics: Variables, constants, functions, how scripts are loaded etc
Arrays & Objects: We'll explore these very important data structures in great detail
Control Structures: Understand how to run code conditionally and in loops
A look behind the Scenes: How JavaScript engines work behind the scenes and what that means for us

Deep dives into Core Concepts: ALL the special things about JavaScript function, different syntaxes
Working with the DOM: How to manipulate web pages dynamically via JavaScript (including deep dives and different use-cases)
Events in JavaScript: Learn how to listen to a broad variety of events (e.g. drag & drop) and execute appropriate code
Classes & Object-oriented Programming: Learn how to work with classes, prototypes, the ""this"" keyword, constructor functions and much more

Asynchronous and Synchronous Programming: We'll explore callbacks, promises, async/ await and other important tools and language features to execute code correctly
Http Requests: Learn how to send Http requests via JavaScript
Tooling, Optimizations & Browser Support: Code splitting, producing small code and ensuring that scripts work in all browsers - this matters and hence is covered in great detail
Libraries & Frameworks: Learn about libraries like Axios or frameworks like React.js - why they matter and how to use them

Node.js: Whilst focusing on the browser-side for the majority of the course (because the syntax is the same), we'll also have a dedicated section on Node.js to learn all about that JS host environment
Security & Performance Optimizations: Of course security matters, so does performance - no surprise that both is covered in the course!

Automated Testing: Testing manually is hard work and can be unreliable - in this course you'll also get an introduction into automated testing

Who this course is for:



Beginner web development students who have no or only little JavaScript experience
Also developers who know the basics about JavaScript and want to deepen their knowledge
Advanced JavaScript developers who want to learn more about the nitty-gritty details and dive into advanced concepts
Everyone interested in learning JavaScript and all about how it works50+

There are some concepts in JavaScript, that often lead to confusion and errors - that's exactly what we'll dive into in this course!

This course will explore the following ""tricky parts"" in depth AND in understandable words, so that you can use this course both as a reference you come back to in the future as well as a resource to strengthen your JavaScript knowledge:


Scope & Hoisting
Callback Functions (Indirect vs Direct Function Execution)
Loops (yes, they do contain some ""weird"" parts)
Primitive vs Reference Values
Value Types & Type Coercion
Recursion
Closures
Asynchronous Code (Callbacks, Promises, async/ await)
The ""this"" Keyword
Prototypes

Those concepts will be explained in detail and theory as well as in practice with short and concise code snippets and examples.

You will learn:


What's tricky about those concepts
WHY it works the way it works
WHAT you should remember or keep in mindImportant: This course is NOT a course for beginners! JavaScript knowledge is expected!

But you don't have to be an expert or advanced user.

This course aims to help you understand those tricky concepts, it's also meant to be a resource you can dive into if you just want to look up one specific concept (instead of having to search through an entire JavaScript course).

Therefore, every course section is built such that it works standalone, independent from the other sections. There is no overarching course project or anything like that - instead, you get ""to the point"", focused sections that have the goal of making those ""tricky parts"" less tricky as quickly as possible!9+

... and much more!

This course is a hands-on course - you'll learn by writing code/ commands. We'll work on a wide variety of example data and use-cases and by the end of the course, you'll have all the knowledge you need to work with MongoDB in your next project!

This course is for you, no matter which programming language you plan on using, you'll learn a uniform way of interacting with MongoDB that can be easily applied to any language.This course is for you:


... if you're brand-new to MongoDB and databases in general
... if you got some basic database or even MongoDB experience - in this course, there are different entry points you can choose from!
... if you are a web or mobile app (or desktop app) developer who considers using MongoDB
... if you're working in a team that considers using MongoDB (or already does use it)
... if you are primarily using SQL-based databases so far and you want to explore the most popular NoSQL alternative

This course is NOT for you:


... if you're looking for a guide on administrating MongoDB servers => This course focuses on the commands/ queries you write, it's NOT an administration course. I will show (in detail) how to deploy a ready-to-use cloud MongoDB solution that follows best practices though.15+

EVERY web developer has to know CSS.,"CSS - short for Cascading Style Sheets - is a ""programming language"" you use to turn your raw HTML pages into real beautiful websites.

This course covers it all - we start at the very basics (What is CSS? How does it work? How do you use it)? and gradually dive in deeper and deeper. And we do this by showing both practical examples as well as the theory behind it.Getting started with CSS might look easy but there actually is a lot of depth to CSS - hence this course provides different ""Tracks"" or ""Entry points"" to exactly meet your demands and reflect you current knowledge level:



The Basics Track: Start from scratch, learn CSS from the ground up. You start with lecture 1 and simply follow through to the end.

The Advanced Track: You already know the CSS basics, you know what selectors are and how it works but you want to dive in deeper and learn some advanced features and usages.

The Expert Track: You got the advanced knowledge, too, but you want to dive into things like Flexbox, CSS Grid, CSS Variables or Sass. This track is for you.

Of course this course offers the theory and practical examples - we'll build an entire real course project throughout the course - but there also are multiple assignments, quizzes and challenges for you to practice individual concepts taught throughout the course.

Talking about the course project - we'll build the frontend (no backend) of a fictional web hosting company. We'll have a starting screen which has different sections, we got a responsive design with an animated side-drawer, we got modals and forms and in general we got a lot of CSS animations, font styles and more!Here's what's inside the course in detail - this is all also applied to the mentioned course project:


The basics about selectors, combinators and how you set up styling rules in general
Properties, values and decalarations
How specifity and inheritance work and why it's called ""Cascading"" Style Sheets
Important theoretical concepts like the ""Box Model""
How the default position of elements can be changed
Styling backgrounds (e.g. gradients) and images
Which units and dimensions you typically use in CSS (px, rem, % and more)
How JavaScript and CSS interact
Responsive design and what ""Mobile First"" means
Styling forms and form inputs
Working with text, fonts and text styles
Flexbox! How it works and how to use it
Using the CSS Grid and how it differs from Flexbox
Transforming and animating HTML elements with the help of CSS
Writing future-proof CSS with features like CSS variables or best-practice class names
Using Sass and what it actually is all about

Is this course for you?

It's for you if ...


you started with learning web development and you want to build more beautiful websites
you already know CSS but want to dive deeper
you're using CSS in a trial-and-error manner and want to change this (you should!)

You might come back later if ...


you're an absolute CSS pro and you know the CSS working group drafts by heart
you're a backend-only developer (Node, PHP, NO HTML or frontend JavaScript)
you're a total newcomer to web development and you don't know the basics about HTML20+

Angular 1 and NodeJS, together with ExpressJS (a NodeJS Framework) and MongoDB formed the very popular MEAN stack. Now is the time to dive into MEAN 2.0 and replace Angular 1 with Angular 2+.

Benefit from the many improvements and advantages Angular offers you: Speed, ease of development, highly reactive, awesome support for asynchronous operations, great scalability and more!And combine these advantages with the power of a NodeJS + Express + MongoDB backend!

Learn or refresh the Angular basics!

This course is no Angular course, but it includes detailed explanations of the core concepts used as well as about Angular in general. However, keep in mind that, as this course is no Angular course, having additional resources like my ""Angular - The Complete Guide"" course is recommended.

In this course, I (Maximilian), an experienced web developer as well as author of many top-rated courses and host of the ""Academind"" coding channel on YouTube, will take you on a hands-on journey to get you to build your own Angular + NodeJS applications in no time.This course follows a hands-on approach, which means that the whole course is structured around one big application and the different concepts will be explained detailedly as they are introduced in this application.

Specifically, you will learn how to:


Set up a NodeJS + Express + MongoDB + Angular Application with the help of the Angular CLI
Use NodeJS and Express efficiently
Build reusable Components in Angular and create a reactive User Experience with the Tools provided by Angular
Connect your NodeJS (or any other language!) backend with your Angular App through Angular’s HttpClient service
Provide appropriate endpoints on your Backend, for your Frontend to consume
Add advanced features like file upload and pagination
Make your Application more secure by implementing Users, Authentication as well as Authorization
Handle Errors gracefully
And much more...!

This hands-on concept allows you to not get stuck in the theory, but instantly see real implementation examples!Don’t stop at the basics!

Do you know those courses which show you a ""Hello World“ example and then call it an end? That won’t happen to you in this course. While beginning with a very basic app and basic features, you will quickly be able to incorporate many different features like Routes, Observables, Events, Authentication and Authorization, Error Handling and much more into your applications.

The best thing is: You’ll learn all that by putting it into practice immediately! No wall of powerpoint slides, no unrealistic mini-examples – this is the real deal!12+

Zero server config APIs &amp; SPAs","Serverless computing will shape the future of web development since it allows you to get rid of many issues ""traditional"" web hosting poses.

Now's the time to dive into this exciting new technology!

Unlike in traditional web hosting, where you spin up servers, configure them and then deploy your code, in serverless applications, you don't manage any servers! Instead, you only provide your code and define when it should get executed. Done!

Without managing any servers, you typically pay way less (since you got no overhead capacity), can react much better to incoming traffic spikes and don't have to worry about server security!

For these very reasons, it's no wonder that serverless computing is on the rise, with more and more companies adopting it! Learn it now to gain an edge and either use it for your own projects or apply for high-paid jobs!What does this course offer then?

This course will introduce you to serverless computing and then quickly dive into how to build serverless apps with Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Specifically, you will learn:



how you can build a REST API without worrying about servers, using AWS API Gateway
to set up your on-demand code via AWS Lambda 
how to execute that Lambda code whenever incoming requests reach your defined REST endpoints
how you can store data in a database - naturally without managing any database servers!

We won't stop there though! Instead, you'll then dive even deeper into serverless computing and learn:


how you can add user authentication to your existing frontend apps and how you can then also protect your REST API against unauthenticated access with ease!
how you can easily integrate a complete user sign up & sign in flow (including user confirmation) into ANY app (web app, iOS or Android app!) with AWS Cognito

how to deploy your web app in a serverless manner
how to speed up the delivery of your static web app assets
how to secure your serverless app

what else you can build with the services covered in this course and which other services might be interesting to you
where to dive deeper regarding advanced development workflows 

and much more!Is this course for you?

Now that you know what this course offers, is it the right choice for you? Which skills should you bring?

This course is absolutely the right choice for you if you're interested in providing great web applications without worrying about the provisioning of servers.

It's also the right choice if you already got experience as a system administrator but are interested in keeping up with the latest developments and the many new possibilities serverless computing offers.

You will need some basic AWS knowledge, or the willingness to dive deeper into AWS alongside taking this course. Additionally, a credit card is required for signing up to AWS.

Finally, you should be familiar with APIs and SPAs (Single-Page-Applications) and which role they play in today's web development environment. You don't need to know how to create them though.

I'd be very happy to welcome you on board!8+

This course teaches you the latest version of Ionic from scratch with no prior knowledge about it assumed.

React.js allows you to create awesome web applications powered by TypeScript or JavaScript. Wouldn't it be great to use that React knowledge to build web applications that can be compiled into native mobile apps, running on any iOS or Android device? And also publish them as progressive web apps at the same time.

The Ionic framework allows you to do just that! Use your existing React, HTML, JS and CSS knowledge and build your native mobile app with that! Ionic offers a lot of beautiful components (which you'll learn about in this course) that can be used to compose native-like user interfaces.

Capacitor (another tool provided by the Ionic team) will handle the rest as it's used to then build a native mobile app for iOS/ Android based on your code. This allows you to focus on the things you know and release your application on all possible devices (desktop and mobile) without having to learn thousands of different languages! Indeed, with Ionic, you can use one codebase to ship three different apps (iOS, Android, web).No wonder that hybrid frameworks like Ionic are extremely popular and in high demand!

My name is Maximilian Schwarzmüller and I'm a freelance web developer as well as creator of many top-rated courses - including my ""React.js- The Complete Guide"" course, the bestselling React course you can find!

I love creating awesome web applications and it simply is amazing to now use that knowledge and build native mobile apps with it, too!

This course takes your from zero to published app, taking a very practice-orientated route. You'll a realistic app (where users can create and book events) throughout the course, learning about the basics of Ionic, its rich component library, how to fetch and handle user input, how to store data and access native device features and much more!

You'll dive into all important Ionic components as well as concepts like navigation (tabs, sidemenus), user input, native device features (e.g. camera), storage, http, authentication!

And since building apps is only part of the fun, you'll of course also learn how to run your apps either in the browser, on an emulator or on your own device!What exactly are you going to learn then?


How to set up your Ionic projects
How Ionic works behind the scenes
The basics about Ionic - How navigation works, how your project is structured and you use its rich component library
How to use the many beautiful components Ionic ships with
How to use different kinds of navigation concepts: ""Back""-button-navigation, tabs and sidemenus
How to show modals, alerts, toasts and many, many more useful UI components
How to test the app in the browser, on emulators or real devices
How to fetch and handle user input through inputs, textfields, dropdowns, dialogs etc.
How to access the local device storage and native device features like the camera

So much more ... like styling and theming your app
Finally, you'll learn how to configure your app and publish it to the App Store or Google Play Store (or as a progressive web app)

Different kinds of solving problems (e.g. greedy approaches, dynamic approaches)

By the end of the course, you will have a very solid foundation and a plan on how to tackle any problem and find a fitting algorithm! You will be well-prepared to dive deeper and explore more problems and algorithms.The different concepts are taught step by step with small, focused code examples and all building blocks being visualized on slides to make understanding them as easy as possible!

This course is for you if you want to take the next step as a developer, if you want to ace interviews or if you simply want to grow as a developer.

It assumes no prior algorithm knowledge but you of course need solid programming fundamentals - preferably in JavaScript, the programming language used in this course.9+

Now, I'm a CEO at Clever Programmer and help other people in kicking ass at becoming a profitable developer.",Learn Python through Codecademy Series,"This is meant to guide you through the Codecademy python part and it also to help you get a much better understanding of the code that you to write according to the instructions on CodeCademy.com. This will help you understand many programming concepts and the concepts that are tricky, I open up an interactive prompt and I will also ask you questions along the way to keep it more interactive for you. I believe teaching only works when you actively engage. 



The target audience is beginners or developers looking to pick up Python. I also emphasize the importance of writing good code and I go through the first part really fast.



I will literally be going through every single thing and breaking it down for you so there is nothing for you that would be scary. You can watch me do it and you can simply follow along and you will learn ALL the basics. I swear I wish something like this was out there when I started learning because everyone else explains things in such a complicated way and makes it so boring! I honestly think programming is based upon exploration and creativity rather than some mathematical/logical genius frame of mind! I spent a lot of hard work in making this so I hope you guys enjoy and learn something out of it while having fun! This is targeted towards beginners, for developers looking to learn python, or for individuals looking for a refresher on basics in computer programming!!



You can use this book to help supplement your study and get through this Python course. I am recommending it only because I have personally used when I was starting to learn computer science using Python.
