Thank you for this course. It really piqued my interest in Stoicism and provides great resources for learning more. Paul LaFleur

This is a great introduction to Stoicism by Donald Robertson. I recommend reading his books Stoicism and The Art of Happiness and The Philosophy of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. Both of these books have helped me develop Stoicism as a philosophy for a better way of living and have inspired me to study CBT as a career path. Mark Husher

Thank you Donald for this free course which is a short but very comprehensive introduction to Stoicism. Familiarising myself with The Meditations by Marcus Aurelius and focusing on meaningful passages was the start of my Stoic journey a few years ago. Having experience of your SMRT course on two previous occasions I can highly recommend them. Alison McCone

I found this course an interesting and easy to understand introduction to the study of Stoicism. It has given me a taste to learn more. Thanks.Colin Conway

Donald! This is a wonderful and wonderfully compact introduction to Stoic philosophy. In such a short time, I feel that many users will find that a lot of the common misconceptions that people have about Stoic philosophy as opposed to stoicism with a small S will be readily addressed, and they will come away with the foundation for further exploration and discussion. Thank you for making this available to people free of charge. I will be recommending this to friends of mine who are curious to see what this is all about.

We've lovingly developed, designed, filmed and produced the program to suit all levels from beginner to advanced - those that never imagined playing drums, to the musically gifted. 

The program uses mnemonics and mantra (a linguistic pattern) which are a way of anchoring positive thoughts and affirmations. Tapping the rhythms help you to feel grounded while drumming releases endorphins which makes you feel good.

Together, the repetition of playing the rhythms and saying the mantra out loud or focusing on the mantra as your inner voice form a great program to meditate on and help develop mindfulness and a positive mindset.","[{'What if I am unhappy with the course?': 'We would never want you to be unhappy!

Are you craving more balance, stress reduction techniques that work and a road map to your version of success?

Summer Huntington created a system called Flow State of Mind coaching that has helped people around the world get a handle on the overwhelm and chaos of our modern lives.

This FREE Flow State Foundations course is a gift for you to get started with understanding the core principles of Flow State of Mind coaching, which are daily open monitoring meditation, a specific journalling format for gathering objective feedback, and organizing your task list into four categories that gradually increase in 'intensity' or the amount of mental energy they take.

The Flow State Foundations course get's specific on creating a strong foundation to explore becoming their own Flow coach.

Anyone can do it.

The mindset tools will last a lifetime.

Self awareness is key to long lasting behavioral change.

Small achievable action steps done consistently over time with an emphasis on the Four Day Flow, get results.

The Flow State Foundations course is a FREE mini- course (42 minutes of FREE video coaching) for anyone to get started on finding Flow.

Four Videos Included in this FREE mini-course:

10 Minute Meditation Tutorial - taking you on a non-dogmatic journey through your key energetic centers in your physical body, inviting you to take inventory. This video gives you insight with how to feel into the somatic feedback your body gives you, and to create more awareness of that information. Open monitoring meditation is highly effective in stress reduction, and one of the pillars of a Flow State of Mind Practice.

Mindset Video - Flow State of Mind Foundations - Learn about how to use the Flow State foundations to become your own coach.

Restorative Heart Opening tutorial 1 - How to start doing restorative poses at home that will relieve stress from tight shoulders and chest. Breathing into the heart for maximum stress reduction, increased circulation, greater openness and increased connectedness.

Restorative Heart Opening tutorial 2 - How to reverse the adaptation of chair posture, and stress response and start returning to neutral posture. Learn how to relieve the stress that accumulates in your neck and shoulders.



Some analytical thinkers will want to know how it all works, before getting started. We completely understand and support the need for the nuts and bolts. Please note: we go into much more detail in the course.

The Four Day Flow for work life balance looks like this:

Self Care / No Intensity (bodywork, float therapy, massage, yin yoga, epsom salt bath with essential oils, etc.)

Research / Low Intensity (researching with books, online courses, scholarly articles and/or researching business plans, online platforms, systems, apps)

Productivity / Moderate Intensity (long form emails, proposals, outlines, web design, marketing plans, meetings, phone calls, etc.)

Creativity /High Intensity (writing, photography, filming, creating YOUR body of work, creating art, inventing, collaboration)

Research demonstrates that our minds can really only stay focused on a task for 90 minutes or so before becoming distracted. We also know that multi-tasking dilutes the quality of our work, and being overwhelmed [ low grade fight or flight response] by a huge to do list can create a sense of being paralyzed [freeze] and not knowing how to even get started.

We need solutions that allow people to reclaim their most valuable asset, their mind. Even better, we need to truly understand how to tap into the human phenomenon called Flow State consciousness.



With our the high stress lifestyle, drastic increase in time spent staring into a screen, and the chronic low grade inflammation that results from it... we need recovery based training. One of Summer's fool proof ways to get started with mobility is using RAD Roller Self Myofascial Release tools, use her ambassador code SH at www.radroller.com for 15% off of all products. She also created a course called Pure Mobility that coaches you in best practices for using the All in One Kit.



The Four Day Flow as it pertains to your physical training also looks like this:

No Intensity (joint mobility + Self Myofascial Release -or- yin restorative yoga)

Low Intensity (joint mobility + gentle yoga sequencing)

Moderate Intensity (conditioning, strength training or HIIT intervals at 70-75% of estimated heart rate max)

High Intensity (conditioning, strength training or HIIT intervals at 75-85% of estimated heart rate max)

When you use the four day flow format, you prepare you nervous system for your hardest training day, and you recover immediately following. Randomized training gives randomized results, and sporadic training gives mediocre results at best. Use the four day flow format to take control of your movement training, and begin training with a purpose. More guidance on that in Kinesiologyoga 101, which features 81 video tutorials for physical training integrating Strength Training & Yoga.



How Flow State Foundations works: 

By creating a structure for organizing our priority projects, and moving through this ordered progression of Self Care (first and most important), then Research, followed by Productivity and Creativity (saved for last), we become more efficient and put out our best quality body of work. Many times people with big ideas try to jump right into Creativity mode without doing the groundwork (Self Care, Research, Productivity) and they end up staring at a blank screen or even worse perpetual procrastination.

Get ready to start tapping into Flow State, get more clear on what you want to create in your life, let go of the things holding you back and become more consistent with the Flow State practices that can create huge shifts in your life.

Meaning: To invoke means “to call in” or “to call upon.” When used in meditation, invocation is a technique with which you can summon any type of energy or quality to come to you.

You can use the power of invocation to summon any quality or energy that you want or need….

Strength, Wisdom, Serenity, Compassion, Softness, Warmth, Clarity, Intelligence, Creativity, Healing Power…

Simply make a strong, clear statement to yourself that this quality is now coming to you.

Another wonderful way to use the power of invocation is to summon the spirit or essence of a particular person who has qualities that you desire. If you invoke one of the masters, such as Buddha, Christ, or Shiva you are calling forth the universal qualities which that person symbolizes, which also lie within each of us. For example, if you call for Krishna to work in you and through you, you are summoning in a very powerful way your own qualities of love, compassion, forgiveness and healing ability.

If there is any particular master or teacher or hero or angel with whom you resonate, call upon him or her through invocation whenever you feel the need to manifest his or her special qualities within yourself.

There are number of invocations and all the human needs are covered in this course. Read them and Invoke them as and when required.

You will be able to


Cultivate your special skill or talent very easily.
Grow your business fast and effectively.
Develop Self-love
Handle all your relationships with ease
Heal financially.
Develop a positive attitude towards work

He help entrepreneurs turn their experience, knowledge or passion into a successful business so they can serve millions and make millions.",Everything you need to know to get started in Meditation,"For thousands of years people have used meditation to move beyond the mind's stress-inducing thoughts and emotional upsets into the peace and clarity of present moment awareness. The variety of meditation techniques, traditions, and technologies is nearly infinite, but the essence of meditation is singular: the cultivation of mindful awareness and expanded consciousness.

As an adult, I first started my meditation practice with just two minutes per day. Two minutes! I got that idea from one of the Zen Habits blog, where the author points out how starting with a tiny habit is the first step to consistently achieving it. So even thought two minutes won't make much difference, that's where I started. Whether you're as skeptical as I used to be, or you're well ahead of me with a meditation habit of several hours, I think it's always interesting to find out how new habits affect our brains. I had a look into meditation to see what's going on inside our brains when we do this, and what I found is pretty interesting.



What is Meditation?

There are different ways to meditate, and since it's such a personal practice there are probably more than any of us know about. There are a couple that are usually focused on heavily in scientific research, though. These are focused-attention, or mindful meditation, which is where you focus on one specific thing -- it could be your breathing, a sensation in your body or a particular object outside of you. The point of this type of meditation is to focus strongly on one point and continually bring your attention back to that focal point when it wanders.

The other type of meditation that's often used in research is open-monitoring meditation. This is where you pay attention to all of the things happening around you -- you simply notice everything without reacting.

What Happens in Your Brain When You Meditate

This is where things get really interesting. Using modern technology like fMRI scans, scientists have developed a more thorough understanding of what's taking place in our brains when we meditate. The overall difference is that our brains stop processing information as actively as they normally would. We start to show a decrease in beta waves, which indicate that our brains are processing information, even after a single 20-minute meditation session if we've never tried it before.

How Meditation Affects You


Better Focus
Less Anxiety
More Creativity
More Compassion
Better Memory
Less Stress

In the last decade, I've combined my years of experience as an in-class teacher, published writer and certified consulting hypnotist, with a growing understanding of the unconscious mind, Buddhist psychology, yogic philosophy, and mindfulness meditation to help people overcome the obstacles that have held them back in the past. I've been a registered Consulting Hypnotist and a member of the National Guild of Hypnotists since 2012. I have a B.A. and a B.Ed., taught Creative Writing for over 25 years. I completed a 250-hour yoga teacher training and Levels 1 and 2 in Emotional Freedom Techniques in 2017.","Learn more than 15 healthy, stress reducing strategies during a one-hour, live-streamed webinar","How this Blueprint Can Help You

Whether you're a smoker, a drinker, or an over-thinker, awareness, mindfulness, and better practices are the key to breaking old cycles. In all three cases, the solution is to create a pause between you and your habit that allows you to make better stress-reduction choices. This blueprint is one I developed based on my own smoking, drinking and over-thinking habits and provides you with over 15 better options (many of them mindfulness-based) to choose from.



In this blueprint package, you'll receive:


A link to an article in which I outline the blueprint
A downloadable PDF of the blueprint itself
A one-hour live-streamed webinar in which I go over each of the points outlined in the blueprintWhy You Need this Blueprint

Many cigarette smokers think of smoking as a means of reducing stress. This association is understandable, since ""When a person smokes, a dose of nicotine reaches the brain within about ten seconds. At first, nicotine improves mood and concentration, decreases anger and stress, relaxes muscles and reduces appetite"" (Mental Health Foundation).


However, ""Research into smoking and stress has shown that instead of helping people to relax, smoking actually increases anxiety and tension. Nicotine creates an immediate sense of relaxation so people smoke in the belief that it reduces stress and anxiety. This feeling of relaxation is temporary and soon gives way to withdrawal symptoms and increased cravings"" (Mental Health Foundation).


The fact is that the act of smoking regularly creates a cycle--we're constantly going through withdrawal, feeling stress because of the withdrawal, and then smoking to relieve the ""stress"" of withdrawal.


Although smoking reduces nicotine withdrawal symptoms, which are similar to the symptoms of anxiety, it does not reduce anxiety or deal with the underlying causes (Mental Health Foundation).


A similar cycle exists when we drink alcohol. There's that initial sense of releasing tension. Our mood improves. However, many people report a heightened sense of stress and anxiety the morning after.


According to Health Line, ""Alcohol changes levels of serotonin and other neurotransmitters in the brain, which can worsen anxiety. In fact, you may feel more anxious after the alcohol wears off. Alcohol-induced anxiety can last for several hours, or even for an entire day after drinking.""


Ruminators, or over-thinkers, also experience a similar cycle. The truth is that ""ruminating thoughts, to a certain extent, are actually quite natural. Many people experience temporary rumination when undergoing situational stressors"" (The Psychology Group). Unfortunately, because it's natural and good to ""chew on"" an idea in certain circumstances, our mind can sometimes start to believe over-thinking is necessary in all problem solving situations. In this sense, what is initially helpful, eventually heightens/increases our distress and sends us into that never ending cycle.","[{'When does the course start and finish?': 'The course starts now and never ends!

I specialize in energy healing, alchemy healing and facilitating your soul light journey to find your inner truth.",Five Effective and Easy to Implement Tools for Inner Peace,"Hi Alchemists! I'm Tiffany Tin, founder of My Inner Temple and the New Earth Alchemists Academy.

I help people reconnect with themselves deeply to learn how to heal emotional wounds to overcome inhibiting fears, restore into wholeness and breakthrough to inner peace, confidence and reclaim their authentic self.

When we are healed and empowered, we are more grounded, confident, in the flow, assertive and have healthy boundaries.

When we struggle with our emotional wounds, it can affect us in many ways. In my career what I have noticed is that these thought patterns are very sneaky! They hide in our subconscious, and because we have grown so used to them, many of us don't even know they are running in the background and draining our energy. It can cause you to feel stuck or lost.

Emotional wounds are painful, yet most of us are not taught how to heal them. Sometimes it is so painful that we start to feel numb, we feel nothing, or we might act out in anger to protect ourselves. We need to understand and heal our shadows. We need to bring in the light of our consciousness to illuminate these blind spots.

If we let them fester, it manifests itself repeatedly as patterns. You are sitting here asking yourself why did I get into this type of situation again? Or why is this person treating me like this?

All of these thought patterns are disempowering and can make us feel helpless to change our experience or circumstances.

The good news is that it doesn't have to be this way! That repeating cycle can end, starting today.

When we learn how to look into our shadows and transmute it into light through Alchemy Healing, it benefits our lives in so many ways:


Increase Emotional Intelligence, Interpersonal effectiveness

By learning about our trigger points and shadows, we begin to understand what drives ourselves and other people to behave a certain way. We become more compassionate and non-judgmental towards ourselves and others.


Connect quickly to the power of your inner voice and learn how it guides you in your healing process in a positive way

With this new found level of consciousness, you will be able to understand exactly why you are feeling or behaving a certain way and be able to express yourself clearly to others. This will decrease the frequency of misunderstandings and deepen your connection with others. You will know what is bothering you, triggering you, and how you can meet your own emotional needs.


Gain the clarity you need to connect to your emotional body quickly, cut down time spend on overthinking

My family struggled financially when I was a child. It was an unhealthy environment and caused many traumatic memories. I also struggled with huge self esteem issues because I was constantly bullied in school. After years of fragmentation and not healing myself, I developed panic attacks, I slept 16 hours a day because of depression, and I had one abusive relationship after another, until one day I just had it. I WANT to CHANGE my life.

I was feeling really tired and drained from overthinking and ruminating, thinking that I can THINK myself out of depression. I had the right intention to heal but I wasn't going at it with the right tools and techniques. I set out to research, I took some courses, and I went on to obtain several certifications. Now I am confidently leading successful healing workshops, classes, and retreats, and watching hundreds of people transform in front of me because of the information I share. Although life is a journey, I am finally able to feel happy with who I am, I kicked abusive relationships to the curb, and I found my loving partner. If I can do it, you definitely can too! 


Quick and Easy to Implement techniques proven effective even if you have a busy schedule 



Emotional healing seems like a hard to grasp topic, where do you even start? In this course, I break it down in an organized and concrete pathway so you can follow along with me without feeling overwhelmed. Videos are bite-sized, digestible and straight to the point.",,58:25:00

She completed her Masters of Social Work from the University of Toronto and has over 10 years experience specializing in women's mental and reproductive health. She has supported women through various mental health challenges, life transition and reaching their personal goals.","How to incorporate more kindness, understanding and compassion into your life.","This course is all about fostering a sense
of gentleness and softness in the way that you talk to yourself and care
for yourself. If you have been catching yourself being really critical,
feel completely out of touch with your wants/needs, and in need of deep
restoration, you are gonna love this course. Because in this series, you
will learn how to create a space where you can cultivate more kindness,
understanding and self-compassion in your life.

Here is all the cool stuff you will experiment with in
this course:

Module One: We will review the importance of mindfulness,
and how to catch mindful moments if meditating for 30 minutes a day seems
laughable to you right now. You will be guided through a quick and easy mindfulness
meditation.

Module Two: We will examine elements of Cognitive
Behavioural Therapy and how you can begin challenging self-critical thoughts. You
will get some concrete strategies for quieting down that mean voice in your
head that whispers (or sometimes yells) cruel and untrue things.

Module Three: We will take a look at ways to incorporate
self-care into your life and begin creating some more space for you. Don’t
worry – this isn’t about taking more bubble baths. You will brainstorm what brings
you pleasure and create strategies to connect with pleasure able and restorative
moments more often.

Module Four: We will discuss boundaries and the importance
of learning how to create them and set them with those around you. Learn how to
connect with your ‘no’ and your ‘yes’, as well as how to communicate your no/yes
with those around you in little and big ways.

reflection questions,

the opportunity to discuss your thoughts and experiences with other retreatants.

What participants are saying about this retreat:


The people came alive through the meditations in a way I had not experienced before.
I thought more about the people of the story rather than the story itself—and that was a gift.
The meditations were very sweet and I appreciated the questions.
It gave me a new lens through which to see the various people who were involved in this story historically and I liked the connection to the other retreatants.
Because of the meditations, I was better able to humanize the different Advent and Christmas stories. I was able to reflect on the people in these stories as multi-dimensional, as people instead of as archetypes or symbols or characters flat from so many retellings.

An
optional individual one-hour session of spiritual guidance via Skype/FaceTime
or phone is available for a US$75 fee.","[{'How long will I have access to the retreat?': 'The retreat is ongoing, which means you will have access to it for as long as you need.

My name is Daniel, Colombian healer, dance psychotherapist, and meditation teacher. I'm here to help you overcome stress and exhaustion, while reclaiming your peace and vitality. Over the last decade, I've lived and travelled through Latin America, Europe, Asia and the Middle-East in a personal quest to learn from the greatest teachers on earth: Amazonian shamans, clinical psychologists, Himalayan Yogis, Buddhist monks and new age gurus. It's been a fun ride, but the time has come to share this life-changing wisdom with you!",How to overcome stress and anxiety with a 10-minute meditation (that actually works),"Are you craving deep relaxation and mental clarity? Have you tried all the health fads under the sky only to find you're still stuck in old patterns of stress, low-energy, and anxiety? Are you fed up with distractions, shiny objects, and false promises? If so, this course is for you: stop fighting anxiety and start befriending your own mind through this simple 10-minute meditation.



In this free course you will learn:



How meditation changes your brain and boosts feelings of confidence, inner peace and self-love
2 breathing techniques to activate your body's relaxation response
The 3 keys to an enjoyable and effective meditation: Breath, Gratitude, and Love
How to integrate meditation into your daily life for improved health and performance
Natural foods and remedies that help reduce anxiety
Why meditation is the new caffeine (but without all the jittery side-effects)



I've created this course because it breaks my heart to see an increasing number of people falling into illness, depression and chronic anxiety (especially teenagers and children who are forcefully prescribed toxic medication). If you're suffering from any of the above or know others who are, I truly believe our paths have crossed for a beneficial reason. This course was designed for people who are looking for a simple and natural way to overcome stress and anxiety. There is plenty of scientific evidence around the benefits of meditation. Even though I bring these important facts into account, I also share my personal experience on how meditation has helped me work through difficult moments.



By the end of the course, you will have learned an effective 10-minute meditation to overcome stress and anxiety. Furthermore, you will have laid solid foundations for a life-long practice that will continue to nurture your health and happiness. Inner peace will no longer be a distant dream but your default mode of Being. You will wake up feeling energized, motivated and on purpose. Finally, you won't need to worry about living in stress or anxiety. Are you ready to thrive and become an inspiration for others?","[{'When does the course start and finish?': 'The course starts now and never ends!

His work has been described as “demystifying & imaginative.” Elliott's work is aimed at empowering the individual & loving one another so that we may create a paradise as one.",Learn how to practice a calm and clear mind,"Mindfulness is living in the present moment with full awareness and openness to what’s going on around us. Mindfulness is a natural experience available at any given moment and with daily practice can greatly enhance your quality of life. Whenever you bring awareness to what you’re directly experiencing without judgement or commentary you’re being mindful.

WHY IS MINDFULNESS IMPORTANT?

Mindfulness creates a shift in your state of experience by opening your awareness to a level of open monitoring - having the ability to experience life without the constant judgement, identification, interpretation and emotional reactions is very liberating and results in personal freedom.

Did you know - Mindfulness can also help alleviate stress by improving emotion regulation, leading to a better mood and better ability to handle stress.



HAVE YOU EXPERIENCED THESE SYMPTOMS?


Feelings of anxiety and worry
Feeling irritable, agitated and easily annoyed
Argumentative and defensive with friends and family
Restless sleeping
Low levels of energy, often waking up feeling tired
Restless and frenetic mind
Often self-critical and/or critical of others
Feeling flat and uninspired
Having difficulty concentrating
Skin rashes and conditions
Clenching your jaw muscles and grinding your teeth at night
Headaches and migraine



Mindfulness is not only about being more aware but is also an excellent antidote to the symptoms caused by stress.

When you learn to regularly abide in a state of mindfulness the benefits will include:


Higher brain functioning
Overcome past trauma
Increased immune function
Lowered blood pressure
Lowered heart rate
Increased states of well being
Enhanced attention and focus
Increased clarity and perception
Lower anxiety levels
Experience of being calm and internally still
Experience of feeling connected

WHAT WILL I LEARN FROM THIS COURSE?


Cultivate a more mindful mind by shifting your experience from thought identification to thought observation. 
Become a more skilful observer to the sensations that flow through your body experience, resulting in a stronger connection to a higher Self
Learn how to open your being to the environment — inviting external sounds to move through our body, without judgement or interpretation.

The mind is a very powerful organ and heartbreak is a very powerful emotion. When the two combine, it can certainly produce a physical reaction.”

Recovering from a breakup can be hard work. And it’s not just in your head — there can be physical effects, too.

Recent research has found that people who have recently been through a breakup experience similar brain activity when shown photos of their loved one as they do when in physical pain. Researchers concluded that rejection, and emotional and physical pain, are all processed in the same regions of the brain.



Truth is breakup is really bad for your health. You might think it's all in your head, but it's not. You truly are experiencing an illness.

It's called Heartbreak Syndrom in medical terms

When you get your heart broken, though, all those lovey-dovey chemicals wash right out of your system, leaving you victim to stress hormones. Your brain pumps your body full of cortisol and epinephrine. Overactive stress hormones is bad for your health. Creating un-ease which can lead to dis-ease.

WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT IT?

This 3 part series has been designed to bring you into a relaxing light trance, known as the alpha state. In this pleasant state, you can visualize yourself happy, joyful and loving again. While you are in the alpha state, your frontal lobe does not recognize the difference between fantasy and reality, which allows you to reverse the physiological effects of your painful heartbreak. Additionally, whilst in the alpha state, your normally locked subconscious mind opens, allowing you to reprogram it by intentionally replacing repetitive negative thoughts with healing and loving ones.

Course Breakdown:

1) BREATHE AND LET GO : In this lesson we go into the bodies nervous system to release the unsettled toxic energy, through the breath.

2 ) LIBERATION: In this lesson we learn to liberate the shackles from our past by going into the flushing out the unwanted energy from the body.

3) RISE ABOVE HEARTACHE: In this lesson we rise above the emotional body to enter an alpha state of mind.

This is a very effective mini-course for anyone who wants to reclaim their power, energy and balance to help move on and be happy again.



WHAT THIS COURSE OFFERS?

This course offers you a direct connection into the emotional body as the witness to observe the unwanted energy, known as ""heartache"". In this process you will be the conscious perceiver and not the emotion.

By shifting your experience from identification to observation, allows the body to naturally flush out stressful feelings. But you have to do the work, and focus on the solution to becoming a better version of yourself, breaking free the shackles of the past.

This is a very visual course, taking you on an epic journey to discover your inner buddha. This course is different from our other course ""Inner Buddha"" as it offers more of inner journey then a practice.

What is Buddha ? 

The word Buddha simply means the Awakened One, the supreme enlightened being or consciousness. Siddharth Gautam (Buddha) believed that everyone has an enlightened potential within themselves, which in most humans stays in sleeping state, unless awakened through meditation.

Looking deep within, observing without any reaction is the key to awaken the buddha (the inner enlightened awareness ) within. This course presents a journey for your being - helping purify the mind, and liberating blocked energy from the body, to clear the path towards your Inner Buddha.



Why do I need to awaken my Inner Buddha?

We all inherently possess the inner buddha state, your inner sanctuary, where you find peace and solace in your own being. Living our modern-day lifestyles can create anxiety and stress, worrying about mind made problems. This scattered energy, accumulates into unsettled energy, disturbing the natural coherence in our body potentially resulting in dis-ease. Awakening your Inner Buddha promotes a very peaceful, healing state in the body, increasing your vitality and energy. When you learn how to connect with your Buddhahood, there will be a sense of tranquillity, harmony and coherence.

WHAT WILL I GAIN BY DOING THIS COURSE?


Stronger connection to a higher Self
Increased Self-Awareness
Clarity and focus
Inner balance
Intuition develops
Expanded consciousness
Less reactive and more responsive
Enhanced cognitive functioning
Peacefulness



This course is an adventurer taking you on an inner journey to discover powerful insights that point you in the direction of the Inner Buddha. This inner journey has been broken up into 4 parts but essentially one big meditation to awaken your Inner Buddha.

Take the journey now ....

How do you feel as soon as you get up? Tired, sluggish, achy, moody...?

I'm going to share exactly what I do, why I do it, and why it' so important to have a simple routine for the morning. Starting your morning with a simple routine sets the tone for the rest of your day.

My name is Rev. Hirosato Yoshida. I am an ordained Soto Zen Priest. I worked at the Sotoshu Administrative Headquarter in Tokyo Japan for 8 years. The first 3 years, I was placed in the Dissemination Department, creating events and informational contents for temples and lay community. Then I was transferred to the International Department, which I was there for 5 years. Those 5 years gave me the opportunity to see with my own eyes of people in North America, South America, Europe and Asia. As I traveled to different countries and met different people with variety of cultural background, I realized that there are so many people that don’t challenge themselves and give up living up to what they are worth. Working with these individuals, I realized that my experience and knowledge that I accumulated through my training at the Zen monastery and the philosophical teachings behind Zen can help millions of people to live up to their dreams by teaching them how to be mindful and live the moment, instead of worrying about the future and regretting the past, by simply understanding the self. So, in the effort of sharing my knowledge, I decided that I need to reach out to help people understand themselves to reach their full potential.",Simple Formula to do Zen Meditation,"Life can get overwhelming sometimes, especially in a business environment. There are so many factors that can influence your emotion and you can lose control of yourself. In order to keep your calm and to be the best without over stressing, you need to learn how to self control. And the best solution to that is by meditating. By meditating, you learn more about your own self, thus allowing you to ""ACT"" in stressful situation instead of ""REACT."" So learn to meditate anywhere quick so that you can be the person you were born to be and be respected for who you really are.




WHAT'S INCLUDED IN THE COURSE?



Video Tutorials on how to meditate

We all need guidance to learn. I have many people coming to visit me to learn how to do Zen Meditation. They all say, they tried at home but didn't know if they were doing it correct. Even though there are hundreds of books and magazine that teaches you how to do it, it isn't the same when you can see and hear. That is why so many travel the distance to come to the temple to learn.

So with so many requests made to me, for the first time, I made a course so that you can learn at home, at work, on-the-go. Now you don't have to travel to the temple to learn how to meditate like Zen Monks and Priests.




Private Support
